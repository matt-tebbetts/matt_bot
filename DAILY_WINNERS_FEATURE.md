# Daily Winners Summary Feature

## 🏆 **What I Added:**

I've created a new automated task that posts daily game winners every night at 11 PM, similar to how the mini crossword summary works.

### **📅 Schedule:**
- **Time**: 11:00 PM every day (23:00)
- **Frequency**: Runs every 10 minutes but only posts during the 11:00-11:09 PM window
- **Scope**: Posts to all connected Discord servers

### **🎯 How It Works:**

1. **Background Task**: `daily_winners_summary()` runs continuously
2. **Time Check**: At 11 PM, it triggers the posting sequence
3. **Message**: Posts "🏆 **Daily Game Winners** - YYYY-MM-DD"
4. **Leaderboard**: Generates and posts the winners image using `/winners` command logic
5. **Multi-Server**: Posts to both "Nerd City" and "Tebbetts Server" automatically

### **📝 Code Changes Made:**

#### **`bot/connections/tasks.py`:**
- Added `daily_winners_logger` for logging
- Created `daily_winners_summary()` task function
- Added task startup logic in `setup_tasks()`
- Follows same pattern as existing `daily_mini_summary()` task

#### **Key Features:**
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and error catching
- ✅ **Multi-Guild Support**: Posts to all connected Discord servers
- ✅ **Proper Timing**: Uses same time-window logic as mini summary
- ✅ **Image Generation**: Uses existing leaderboards system
- ✅ **Logging**: Full activity logging for monitoring

### **🔍 What Gets Posted:**

The daily winners summary will show:
- **Game winners** for each game played that day
- **Organized by game type** (movies, geography, language, trivia, crossword)
- **Clean leaderboard format** using the existing `/winners` command

### **⚙️ Technical Details:**

- **SQL Query**: Uses `daily_winners.sql` (same as `/winners today`)
- **Image Format**: Same PNG format as other leaderboards
- **Channel**: Posts to default channel for each guild
- **Logging**: Tagged with `daily_winners_summary` for easy monitoring

### **🎮 Example Output:**

```
🏆 Daily Game Winners - 2025-08-29
[Attached: winners_leaderboard.png showing today's game winners]
```

The image will show all the game winners organized by category, just like when someone manually runs `/winners today`.

## 🚀 **Ready to Deploy!**

The feature is complete and ready for production. It will:
1. Start automatically when the bot restarts
2. Run silently in the background
3. Post winners every night at 11 PM
4. Log all activity for monitoring

Just like the mini crossword summary, this gives your community a nice daily recap of who won each game! 🎯
