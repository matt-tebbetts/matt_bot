RESPONSE:
It seems that there hasn't been any direct sports conversation in the recent chat excerpts provided. The discussions revolved around various topics, including bot testing, board games, family activities, cooking, entertainment, and video games. The notable interaction in "video-games" was Nick's recommendation of Roadcraft to Matt, prompting Matt to consider purchasing the game. If you're looking for the latest sports discussions, it appears they weren't captured in the provided conversation history.
