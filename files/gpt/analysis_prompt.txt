Someone just called my custom /gpt command on Discord, and I need your help to identify:
1. Whether this prompt is "googleable" (can be answered without server context) or needs internal server context
2. What specific context would be most relevant if needed

For example, these are "googleable" and don't need server context:
- General questions about Python, Discord, or programming
- Questions about the weather, news, or general knowledge
- Questions about how GPT or AI works
- Questions that can be answered with public information

These need server context because they're about internal information:
- Questions about this specific Discord server, its channels, or users
- Questions about server activity, conversations, or patterns
- Questions about the bot's specific implementation or configuration
- Questions about game scores, user interactions, or server-specific features
- Questions that reference or ask about recent messages or conversations

IMPORTANT: 
- Unless the user specifically mentions another channel, always include the current channel in the filter
- If the question is about the server, bot, or conversations, it needs context

Please respond in this exact JSON format:
{
    "needs_context": true/false,  # true if NOT googleable, false if googleable
    "explanation": "brief explanation of why",
    "filter_params": {
        "channels": ["channel1", "channel2"] or null,
        "users": ["user1", "user2"] or null,
        "keywords": ["word1", "word2"] or null,
        "guild_name": "name of the guild",  # This is required
        "current_channel": "channel_name"  # This is required
    }
}
