#science-and-technology:
Matt: so like
acowinthecrowd: or at least a ton of bots
Matt: if you give your kid a device it's up to YOU to try to regulate it
Matt: I mean you KNOW it's the wild west
Matt: of all people, our generation knows the most
Matt: so like... why would you do that, and allow them to use these apps?
Matt: isn't it like...
Matt: up to you?
acowinthecrowd: Yeah to that end there have been some huge movements within the phones for kids arenas. Imagine your minimalist app but permanently locked to that
acowinthecrowd: boom
Matt: there ya go
Matt: that's the ONLY solution for me, just do not let your kid use things you don't want them to use
Bergs: I think you are not touching on a critical point that a lot of parents end up giving kids cell phones because of peer pressure cause other parents do ; it's not a super simple solution.  This is where some other intervention (gov, schools, etc) is needed imo
Matt: I disagree entirely
Matt: yes, obivously if the other kids have snapchat, your kid is going to cry about wanting it
Matt: but that's still on you
Bergs: ok well you aren't talking to parents with teenage kids
Matt: you can't just say "well I have to give it to them, so now I need the government to regulate it"
Bergs: it's not that you *have* to
Matt: oh, what do you mean?
Matt: sorry do you mean the argument about like, not wanting to make your kid be a social outcast because they're the only one without the app?
Bergs: sorry I thought you meant you disagreed that parents get pressure on giving kids devices.  

I think generally, we have had an experiment on kids the past 10 or so years, that everyone largely agrees was a failure.  I have not talked to anyone personally , nor anything I've read on the matter indicates that there are pocket of parents out there that think their 12 year old being on instagram is a positive thing.  Same with schools.  Same in different areas of the government.  

There is also a class based discussion here that is another rabbit hole (single working mom relies on youtube and social media to entertain her kids while she does night shifts or whatever).  that needs to be said and acknowledged and I am not sure the answer.

You are correct dude, that in isolation we shouldn't regulate things just because parents can't put their foot down.  But when there is such general consensus that (a) a topic is bad and (b) people want it to change - I don't see even if policy isn't 100% effective we shouldn't try to control it.  To me , putting that burden on individual families doesn't align with how we treat other parts of life from a policy perspective.
Matt: Fair enough! We regulate TV after all. I also agree that it's incredibly unhealthy for kids to be on these apps.

I'm watching a live expirement happen, where my oldest bro manages his kid's screen time, but my other bro basically lets them run rampant and I can see how it makes a very negative impact on the screen watchers.

I'm happy to watch the attempts to mitigate the issue, but my issue is that I just do not see how regulating specific apps or doing ID checks would prevent the issues they're trying to prevent.
sarahsalley951: Sarah has entered the chat
acowinthecrowd: haha you guys are in for it now
sarahsalley951: I mean we are parents of a teenager and in about an hour technically he will be a high schooler
acowinthecrowd: There's also no incentive for the government to even do anything about it. The billionaires behind the apps run the government and they don't want to lose revenue, nor do those lawmakers that hold stock in the companies, on top of the fact it's been made pretty clear that improving the lives of citizens isn't really on the agenda.
acowinthecrowd: thats why we won't see any regulation, regardless of how many people agree there should be
acowinthecrowd: I am on berg's side (ugh) that it is unhealthy and very hard to combat
Matt: Haha, that's a side? I'm on that side too...
acowinthecrowd: so we're all in agreement here
Matt: Literally saying it's impossible to regulate
Matt: No, no
Matt: The other side is "yeah government should try to regulate"
acowinthecrowd: thats an extension, i'm stopping where i stopped
acowinthecrowd: so that we can all agree
Matt: Ah, hahaha
Matt: Well duh but that's boring
sarahsalley951: Yeah I lost interest
Matt: Of course everyone agrees social media can be harmful especially for kids lol
acowinthecrowd: you never HAD interest!
Matt: ^
Matt: Yeah this is the section for endless arguing about technology
sarahsalley951: I had opinions but you guys go too  fast
acowinthecrowd: maybe the physical hardware is where the regulations go
acowinthecrowd: can't buy a Class C Smart Device until 16
acowinthecrowd: Only Class A and B
acowinthecrowd: Class A is a flip phone
B is one of those control phones
Matt: Lol I think they/we need to step back and think about what actual problem we're trying to solve here
acowinthecrowd: since you said the physical items are easy to regulate
Matt: Yeah sure! I like that idea...
Matt: But, still you can't hide the internet from kids, that's still just parenting
Matt: So, even regulation on that...
Matt: No point
Matt: Parents are the ones buying the phone and giving it to the child
Matt: Again... The real question is
Matt: What is the specific problem?
Matt: Like... Back to Jon's post
Matt: What's the specific problem? Advertising?
Matt: It's kinda hard to define what the actual problem is
sarahsalley951: Oh I did want to ask about this. I have found through years of my kids and my friends, all this depends on the kids too
sarahsalley951: Like how old are the kids
Matt: Right? For sure, and how much good parenting have they had?

People who value their own self worth and aren't as impacted by advertising/algorithms are that way because of their parents
acowinthecrowd: Ours? very little good parenting
sarahsalley951: Oh because I just pulled out Popsicles to make pool Margaritas? That's bad parenting??
sarahsalley951: Also I think the first thing that needs to happen is that every school district needs to ban phones through 8th. Instead they basically make them mandatory. You can't win against that
acowinthecrowd: Oh band practice is going 30 min later than the calendar said?
acowinthecrowd: "so everyone let their parents know please!"
acowinthecrowd: So <@340940380927295491> why do you hate kids so much
Matt: https://tenor.com/view/seth-meyers-right-am-i-right-totally-same-gif-7475706689465415663
sarahsalley951: He could have sent out a text blast to the hood instead he ditched technology and wrote a note
Nick: And he ditched the Js
sarahsalley951: Strictly school shoes. Not allowed to wear those at other times. Even his friends haha
Andy: https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1ksh3iy/all_these_videos_are_ai_generated_audio_included/

The video on this link is bananas
Andy: I think i'm behind some kind of global internet regulation where there's a way to prove something is human made, and anything not from a verified human is trated as slop
Bergs: Video games are gonna look so insane in a few years
Andy: Wtf I love AI now!
Nick: Are they not insane now ?
Nick: We dont even have hardware for most common consumers to run games at max settings today
Andy: Tbf, while the look great, this is photorealism
Matt: Agreed but at some point, imagine playing NBA 2K and they are just literal VIDEOS of the actual players
Nick: I always think of the movie gamer , and how far away are we from that
acowinthecrowd: wowzers
acowinthecrowd: the only thing blatantly unnatural is the walking, sometimes
Big Jon: We can finally settle the goat debate with a 1 on 1
acowinthecrowd: hahahaha
Bergs: No not really
Bergs: They look like video games
Nick: <@487577343079088128> have you tried this app ?
Nick: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brickit.brickit
Bergs: Nope what is it - building ideas?
Nick: Basically.  You take photo of all your bricks and it gives suggestions on what you csn build with instructions
croasus: Are the suggestions for real sets with real instructions? Or is it basically chatgpt for Legos?
Nick: Looks like user/chatgpt not official <@163822913848475649>
Nick: Also looks pricey
Nick: 6 bucks a month , adds up quickly
Bergs: It’s a great idea
Bergs: All of ours are in little drawers
Bergs: We have the Lego build app which is sick, but just for sets i think

#rogue-corner-🗡:
Bergs: So
Bergs: Katy customer is CFA
Bergs: She had a dinner with them last night
Bergs: She said they are soooooo weird
acowinthecrowd: Ya I am not surprised
Bergs: The head lady doesn’t drink
Bergs: They went to a steakhouse
Bergs: No one else will drink when she’s there
Bergs: Like not even a glass of wine haha
Bergs: ////////////////////////////////
Bergs: Ok
Bergs: 90FPS
Bergs: 1.68GB
Bergs: God i love indie games
acowinthecrowd: Not any lagging?
acowinthecrowd: when placing units?
Bergs: Nope
Bergs: Smooth as a dick through a hallway
acowinthecrowd: DANG
acowinthecrowd: ok I'll buy it again and figure it out
Bergs: Excellent
acowinthecrowd: ok no issues
Bergs: 🎉
acowinthecrowd: you like it/
acowinthecrowd: drinking is a sin
acowinthecrowd: your body is a temple
acowinthecrowd: https://tenor.com/view/am-ia-joke-to-you-meme-original-video-am-ia-joke-joke-to-you-gif-27389464
acowinthecrowd: -Catholocism
acowinthecrowd: bergs i'm capped at 60 fps
Bergs: I think the oled has a 90hz screen
acowinthecrowd: ah
Bergs: Out doing wine now
acowinthecrowd: fun
acowinthecrowd: Is this work stuff
Bergs: Haha no I ditched this afternoon
acowinthecrowd: Oh fun
Bergs: The artwork is much better in mt2 I've noticed
acowinthecrowd: A thousand times
acowinthecrowd: I leaned real heavy into the Valor mechanic on this one
acowinthecrowd: Final boss didn’t even get into their combat phase
Bergs: I'm not getting the mobile game art work at all which is a great improvement
acowinthecrowd: Yep! Same here
Bergs: It could be actual pixel art
Bergs: Can't tell
acowinthecrowd: I didn’t double check this but someone says whenever you pull up details on a unit it shows the artist which is neat
acowinthecrowd: Some guy named I guess Albert, or Al for short did most of it 🤷
Bergs: Hahaha
acowinthecrowd: The deployment phase is awesome
Bergs: I really enjoyed my first run
Bergs: Explain to me valor and more largely how stacks work
acowinthecrowd: Valor stacks increase your attack in a 1:1 ratio. Additionally at the end of the turn, you’ll gain armor up to your valor stacks. So maybe you’ll get +0 armor if you’re already there
acowinthecrowd: I upgraded the champ to gain *permanent* valor whenever they shifted
acowinthecrowd: And gave them items that triggered shift too
acowinthecrowd: So I was getting ten to twenty permanent per battle from moving it around
acowinthecrowd: It was neat
Bergs: That's awesome
Bergs: I'm still not understanding quite, the pyrophelgm operates in a similar manner I think but only procs if you hit them?
acowinthecrowd: Ya similarly they take one extra damage per stack of that
Bergs: This game is good
Bergs: Very good
acowinthecrowd: I like the addition of equipment and rooms
acowinthecrowd: I hate having to decide what path to take. It never seems like there’s that that has all I need
Bergs: Hahaha
Bergs: That you can play a rogue is a miracle in itself
acowinthecrowd: how close are you to a new faction
acowinthecrowd: i just got one
Bergs: I just did one run last night
Bergs: But I'm in
acowinthecrowd: yeah boy it's fun
Bergs: I gotta show Cal this
Bergs: He's gonna love all the monsters
acowinthecrowd: looks like luna is the casting clan
acowinthecrowd: focus on spells
acowinthecrowd: but a fun mechanic about phases of the moon!
acowinthecrowd: <@487577343079088128> 14,000 players right now
Bergs: Playing concurrent?
acowinthecrowd: ya
acowinthecrowd: it sounds like a lot for 1245 on a thursday
acowinthecrowd: ahy are your shorts so short
acowinthecrowd: is that underwear
Bergs: It's the style apparently
acowinthecrowd: it really shouldn't be
acowinthecrowd: i picture the rest of it is a scrooge mcduck tank top swimsuit
acowinthecrowd: is that what it looks like
acowinthecrowd: a male one piece
acowinthecrowd: Is this the style
Bergs: Do you still wear swim trunks past your knees or something
acowinthecrowd: When you’re a short king, all swimsuits are past your knees
Bergs: Haha such a goon
Bergs: <@163849350827606016> this game rocks
Bergs: I feel like the new room and equipment cards (at least I don't remember them) are great
Bergs: The graphics make such a difference
acowinthecrowd: Those are definitely new
acowinthecrowd: And I love how a simple addition has a ripple effect like now there’s also trinkets that relate to rooms and equipment and upgrade shops for rooms and equipment

#things-we-watch:
Andy: 2004 Horror Anthology, Three... Extremes added to plex, just for US
Andy: Upsetting is the word
Bergs: what the heck is this- what a murderers row
Andy: Haha, yep
Andy: I requested all of Park's shorts
Andy: This is the only one to show up
Bergs: i will have to check it out
Bergs: I am so very excited for his new movie this year
Bergs: and also Mikke's bad lieutenant tokyo
Andy: A sequel? A reboot? A seqboot?!
Bergs: We’re all delighted to reinterpret this iconic IP with a master filmmaker like Takashi Miike,” said producer Jeremy Thomas of Recorded Picture Company. “We’ve produced 10 films in Japan, most recently Grand Maison Paris, which has grossed over $28M domestically, and it’s a fertile place to create and distribute films. I feel the time is right for this irreverent hybrid.”
acowinthecrowd: <@487577343079088128> this made me laugh
Bergs: Hahaha
Bergs: So good
Bergs: https://youtu.be/uww2zyJgbE0?si=aZn3csiP9pWmfMgf
Bergs: <@163849350827606016>
acowinthecrowd: Yay!
acowinthecrowd: Apparently Sarah didn’t watch these with me
acowinthecrowd: She’s never heard of toxic avenger
acowinthecrowd: I wonder who watched it with me haha
mbbananas: <@487577343079088128> the assessment is great - i feel like you would like it
Bergs: Is that the one with the lady that's acting like a kid
mbbananas: Yeah Alicia vikander
Bergs: I'll do it!  Seems like something I can get katy to watch too
Andy: <@487577343079088128> are you in a safe space
Andy: i really need to know you're somewhere comfortable and ideally away from your loved ones
Andy: ||https://deadline.com/2025/05/elden-ring-alex-garland-directing-a24-movie-1236408999/||
Bergs: Don't break my heart
Bergs: Haha yes!  Saw this reported last week.
Bergs: I have mixed feelings in Garland but this sounds like a very cool marriage
Andy: Men rewatch?
Bergs: Haha birth train baby
Bergs: What do you think?  Hype or meh
Andy: errr
Andy: i don't think it really lends itself to a movie beyond a setting
Andy: at least in my case, there's really almost no story
Andy: the only question is which role is Sonoya Mizuno going to have
Bergs: My hope is they lean into the vibes and not do some silly over wrought plot
Bergs: Based on annihilation Garland can absolutely capture the majesty and horror of the game
Andy: Hmmm, maybe
Andy: Hopefully
Andy: While annihilation is a vibes book, it's still a book with a big story
Andy: Seems like after the Mario, Sonic and Minecraft movies were going to get a glut of these, maybe like the epics which came out after LOTR
Bergs: Agreed
Andy: Hopefully this is more Kingdom of Heaven than Clash of the Titans
Bergs: But in this case, you do have talent behind the camera (even if I think he's a fake transgressive fan boy)
Andy: Whats he done to hurt you?
Bergs: The one two punch of Men and Civil War haha
Andy: Eh, civil war slapped
Andy: And while Men did not, I'm not sure how it made him fake or transgressive
Bergs: No no
Bergs: I'm saying he's a cheap wanna be provocateur / transgressive
Bergs: I thought civil war was good
Bergs: But it Def thought it to be edgier than it was - felt like a real missed opportunity
acowinthecrowd: A good example of our channel description
Bergs: 🙄
Andy: I think you're making assumptions about his intent and getting angry about him for missing them
Bergs: Yeah, I think there are glimpses of what I'm assuming (the ending is probably the best example of tapping into it) which makes me think what he's going for
Bergs: The discourse around the movie is painful, I feel like so many critics missed the mark criticizing it for being apolitical - which was the entire point
Andy: Yeah
Bergs: But again, I liked it!  Some of my favorite needle drops in recent memory
Andy: I honestly think his movie was meant to be watched in a similar way as The Road than some super edgy political satire
Bergs: it's hard for me to ignore the more annoying parts of Civil War (in a movie that was supposed to be "apolitical" it sure goes out if it's way to mention Antifa)
Bergs: But anyway
Bergs: Elden Ring
Bergs: Biggest budget movie in A24 history
Bergs: Exciting
Bergs: I'm getting pinged by all the homies <@297550265299763212>
Bergs: Here's another angle
Bergs: Annihilation was a real creative adaptation
Bergs: It was nothing like the book
Bergs: Maybe Garland takes huge liberties with this one and doesn't create the type of story we think
sarahsalley951: The way you fought with me that I did though
acowinthecrowd: still not convinced
sarahsalley951: 3 seconds of the trailer I know I didn't. You did go through a phase where you watched all of bergs weird stuff
acowinthecrowd: this was like, in COLLEGE
acowinthecrowd: i think michael was even there
sarahsalley951: Ok probably
Bergs: <@163849350827606016> hook me up with a rescan of sinners
Bergs: I love Elizabeth Olsen too
Matt_Bot: (bot_response, 44 characters)
acowinthecrowd: Un momento amigo
Matt_Bot: (bot_response, 1579 characters)
Matt: " 'Skibidi Toilet' was mentioned "

hahaha
Matt: glad to know there was casual banter here
acowinthecrowd: It’s done
acowinthecrowd: This was way too long
croasus: yeah we need pithy matt bot
Bergs: <@340940380927295491> there is a film bot that I can link direct to letterbox
Bergs: Can you look into that whenever you have some time
Matt: yeah! do you use this bot already? what does it do? pull your reviews and stuff?
Bergs: No just let's you pull the movie!
Matt: nice nice... but in what context? can you give me an example?
Matt: also you can totally use the "/gpt" command for whatever you would normally ask chatgpt if you want
Matt: (though it may break)
Matt: (or say dumb shit)

#self-improvement:
Bergs: Super cool though our local bookstore had some tattoo guys just set up a chair in it haha
Nick: I like the moon reading
Big Jon: The whale is pretty sick
Bergs: Yeah I'm between the whale, tube wolf and skeleton jester 😂
Nick: Skeleton jester is bad ass as well
Bergs: Yea dude
Bergs: That one is more expensive
Nick: Worth it. Right calf
Bergs: I think whatever i do im going wrist
Bergs: They aren’t big enough for a calf unfortunately or that would be dope
sarahsalley951: I agree!
Big Jon: All three people on Kelsey’s team have tats from this guy
Nick: I know alot if tattoo shops do a Friday the 13th, $13 tattoos like this with a bunch of pre design quick stencil
Bergs: Their instagram pages are so good. Incredibly talented artists- full of whimsy
sarahsalley951: So whimsical
Bergs: SO MUCH WHIMSY
sarahsalley951: I'm so bothered
Nick: So what did you get <@487577343079088128>
Bergs: Going around 4
Big Jon: Think you’ll actually get a spot
Bergs: Let's see!  Looked like I was around 5 on the list
Nick: .... were waiting
Bergs: I'm suited and booted
Bergs: First tat in over ten years!
Nick: Which one
Bergs: Wolf
Bergs: With the tube's
Bergs: I guess a few of these are LOTR haha
Big Jon: Is that the tree of Gondor?
Big Jon: Kelsey’s friend has a full upper arm tree beard from the guy
Bergs: Haha I think so
Big Jon: Sick
Big Jon: I want more tattoos
Bergs: Doing the whole other sleeve next year!
Bergs: So addicting
Big Jon: I liked your advice about not have to make each tattoo have some really deep meaning
Big Jon: I kinda want to copy your approach and bring a bunch of little ideas so someone with better style and than me to see what kind of half sleeve they can come up with
Big Jon: Poppy flower, golden spike, cheese wedge, howler or sons of ares helmet, maybe a raven or something? 🤣
Big Jon: Can’t decide between that or just getting one-offs in different spots as more individual pieces
Bergs: Dude this is the way!! Can't wait to get a xenomorph tattoo haha
Bergs: This can be cool too, sometimes sleeves can look too cohesive imo
Big Jon: Did I send you a picture of Ricky’s sleeve? (Tommy’s brother)
Bergs: I can't remember but I'd like to see it
Big Jon: He got all his favorite video game and movie weapons- wow hammer, gladiator sword, red rising himanthus
Bergs: Yessss
Big Jon: <@320002960719609856>  drop a pic!
Big Jon: And a list of weapons
Bergs: I may do a similar thing to Ricky but with horror flicks
Big Jon: Love that idea
Bergs: Do a tattoo for Cal and Kenna but abstract it to the point you'd never know hahaha
Big Jon: Like their faces as Frankenstein and the monster?
Big Jon: 🤣
Bergs: Haha yeah I'm thinking for Cal, a crazy piece of mecha godzilla cause we watched godzilla a few times 😂, etc
Bergs: Shit like that
Big Jon: On your latest tat- I never know which orientation those should go
Big Jon: It’ll be upside down while you’re standing right? But I guess it’s for you to look at so who cares
Bergs: Yeah I struggle with this too, even wearing rings haha
Bergs: I do usually go decide whatever looks best from your orientation
acowinthecrowd: Should keep the grosstee??
acowinthecrowd: Does it make me look taller??
acowinthecrowd: Maybe just keep the Ron Swanson
Matt: Yes
Matt: Aw I liked the goatee. Did Sarah hate it? I say just go completely full clean shaven
acowinthecrowd: haha yes she did, i am scruff shaven
acowinthecrowd: 1/8"
acowinthecrowd: the final
Bergs: Holy shit
Bergs: THAT’S BRICE
Matt: I forgot he was a regular human under there
Matt: SHAVE THE SCRUFF
acowinthecrowd: ew no
Matt: It's a friggin once in a long time opportunity
acowinthecrowd: everyone looks better with a beard
Matt: Wtf
Matt: It'll come back so fast
Matt: It's fun
Matt: It's fun to look funny
Matt: Lemme see if I have a no beard Pic
acowinthecrowd: what if i told you i clean shaved right after the gotee
acowinthecrowd: and now it's here
sarahsalley951: Ew

Matt: Check me out lol
acowinthecrowd: no
Matt: Hey how I actually had hair
Matt: Man I gotta fix that
acowinthecrowd: see this is why i won't go no beard
acowinthecrowd: might look like that
Matt: Hahahahaha
Matt: It's so funny, it makes the BIGGEST difference
Matt: More than any other trait
acowinthecrowd: i think one of my middle school photos probably doesn't have a beard
Matt: Lmao

Bergs: You can of course set timers for whatever apps you want to limit
Matt: Yeah Brice, who's the non-technical person now!
Nick: Still bergs
Bergs: Sometimes gotta educate the fools of the world how to do the tech stuff
acowinthecrowd: Still bergs
acowinthecrowd: Oh Nick had me covered
acowinthecrowd: So if they watch an hour of kids YouTube then it bricks then they wanna watch lego builds they can’t cause it’s bricked?
Bergs: Lego build is a different app
Bergs: *come around the fire and listen*
acowinthecrowd: I think we have different definitions of a bricked device
Bergs: The apps black out
Bergs: Can’t be used
Bergs: So whatever that is !
acowinthecrowd: So they watch an hour of YouTube kids and the iPad is bricked, meaning all apps are blacked out. 

Yet because Lego builds is a different app they can still get to it?

What am I missing
Bergs: No the YouTube app bricks
Bergs: You can brick it , app by app baby
acowinthecrowd: So…… the device can do anything and everything but play YouTube?
Bergs: Yep.
Bergs: Choose your own adventure
acowinthecrowd: And yet you call that bricked?
Bergs: Yeah in context of a 3 or 5 year old that all they know how to do is watch YouTube?  Bricked
Bergs: If you wanna get technical they COULD still use the digital ruler
acowinthecrowd: “Bricked” means they can use all apps on the device except one specific one?
acowinthecrowd: In most circles, a “bricked” device means it can’t do anything more than a literal, actual brick can do. That’s why I was a little confused about what you meant the kids can do with a device you’ve called “bricked”
acowinthecrowd: I’m *sure* you explained it very well and, as always, I’m the dummy
Bergs: From the kids perspective after YouTube is gone, it's a brick - hence bricked
acowinthecrowd: ⛽️ 💡
Bergs: https://tenor.com/view/cardiachill-diamondhands-gif-21811381
Bergs: Haha your brain
acowinthecrowd: “The iPad bricks after an hour of YouTube. I mean you can use any other app other than YouTube for as long as you want. But it’s totally bricked.”
Bergs: If you give a calculator to a squirrel is it useful?
Bergs: It's wild your inability to abstract even the most simple concepts
acowinthecrowd: I find it crazy that I am assigned the role of “insane” when all I try to do is figure out a concrete definition of a term
Bergs: Has the word insane entered the conversation?  Why is it in quotes haha
acowinthecrowd: Geez more gaslighting.
Bergs: 😂😂😂😂
acowinthecrowd: I find it crazy that I am assigned the role of “wild” when all I try to do is figure out a concrete definition of a term
Bergs: You are a wild boy
acowinthecrowd: Yeah
acowinthecrowd: Wild like a fox
acowinthecrowd: Or something
Bergs: Look at you making some analogies
acowinthecrowd: Analagous like a fox
Matt: I'm with Bruce
Bergs: Well at least you understand my position
Bergs: He's still reeling in confusion
Matt: He's dumb and weird
Matt: Let's ostracize him
Bergs: He's literally, LITERALLY insane
acowinthecrowd: “The device gets bricked”
Oh no I don’t think bricking is necessarily the right option
“Oh well not bricked”
acowinthecrowd: Then,,,, what
acowinthecrowd: OBVIOUSLY I meant the definition of bricked that I meant.
acowinthecrowd: What….??
acowinthecrowd: But no, im the crazy one somehow
acowinthecrowd: Gas. Light.
Bergs: Haha you are loving this term!
Bergs: Did you watch some boss babe content today
Big Jon: Bricked as a very common meaning- the device is completely inoperable and generally won’t turn on. Brice was initially confused, but should have realized that bergs isn’t very precise with his technical language and moved on. Meeting adorned
Bergs: Here here!  To middle mgmt!
Big Jon: 🫡  good work team, let’s circle back next week
Matt: Props to Jon's management skills to get Bergs to agree to a comment that basically said he has no idea what he's talking about
Big Jon: I’m changing teams after this week! bye Luke!
Matt: TEN MILLION ROWS IN THIS TABLE BRO
Big Jon: 4 Billion SKU branch combinations a DAY 🤓
Matt: NUMBERS ARE BIG I'M IMPORTANT
Andy: Thoroughly enjoyable conversation to read after waking up, 10/10 pedantry and intransigence guys
Bergs: Waaaay better than politics
Bergs: The mark of a great people manager is a master manipulator
sarahsalley951: This was all too much to read
sarahsalley951: Also Logan doesn't get anything bricked. He asked me Friday if he had any limits on screentime or VR or if he should use his conscious free will and I said what? I don't care 😂
Nick: Anyone have experience with something like these for concerts ? 

https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B075SJ3Y8M/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=AP3YH085XHE3B&psc=1
Nick: (No they dont block out the concert, they just reduce the decibels to save your ears but allow you to still hear clearly)
Andy: Aurgasm > Eargasm, dreadful marketing
Nick: Trademark ?
Bergs: You know brice is massively hungover when he has only one discord post pre 1030am
Nick: What's the occasion
Matt: Saturday
sarahsalley951: Yeah we watched final destination. What more of an occasion do you need
sarahsalley951: I'm about to make mimosas because Sunday
Nick: <@163849350827606016> did you find a 3rd party remote?
acowinthecrowd: Nope I ended up upgrading roku and I am *happily* using my Bluetooth headphones to watch
Nick: Upgrading software or device
acowinthecrowd: Device. It is SO zippy too haha
acowinthecrowd: Our Roku was over 5 years old
acowinthecrowd: I think
Nick: They have a trade in offer ?
acowinthecrowd: Nah but it was 30% off that’s kinda what sealed the deal
acowinthecrowd: Do you want an old roku box??
Nick: Negative. Thanks though
Nick: After 2 months it finally shipped !!   Joker and Boba fett
Nick: <@178958369955119104>  / <@163849350827606016>  you need to get one of these for the Blackstone 
https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJ7LdlUOGcl/?igsh=bmEyanR4OThyZDBp
acowinthecrowd: Nice that’ll cover like 2.5 cooks!
Big Jon: I would love to hook it up to the houses gas line
Nick: Would you need a different type of flattop ? Assuming its like a bbq ? <@178958369955119104>
Evan: I know this is incredibly last minute and I’m sharing this with several folks, would you like two tickets to see Shucked at the Fox theater tonight (with parking included)? Show starts at 7:30
Nick: @here ^^
acowinthecrowd: Shuck no

#family:
sarahsalley951: Yeah don't let them become teenagers. It's annoying
acowinthecrowd: They don’t want to wear the bk hat when they’re teenagers
acowinthecrowd: I still do of course
sarahsalley951: the one time jack talks to me daily is when I drop him at school and he says "see ya" and that's because months ago I said I would stop driving him unless he at least acknowledged me
Matt: Hahahaha
Matt: Good for you
Matt: I remember being a stinky little teenager
Matt: It only lasted like 5 years though
Matt: So, you'll be good soon
Matt: Except with the Logan overlap
Matt: He's an angel though, right? Right?
sarahsalley951: Yeah he's a dream
sarahsalley951: I just walked by him and he asked for a hug so yeah, he's an angel
Matt: Aw
sarahsalley951: Omg she's going to pop that mat. This is stressful for me
Matt: Man, Harley got her good hahaha
Nick: Him*
Matt: well well well, if it isn't my old friend mister "to", "your" and other grammatical error-maker
Matt: You may have won this time but I'll be back!
Nick: https://tenor.com/view/masters-of-the-universe-skeletor-mot-u-gif-23595861
Nick: So are you living back in smyrna area ?

Matt: hey man, I speak English!
Matt: tell them "hello, governor and governess"
Nick: My next few weekends are shit,  but let's do get something once im back from cali , June 14th
Bergs: Damn <@340940380927295491> he put your thirsty ass on ice
croasus: <@487577343079088128> yeah dude I heard nick would rather have shit weekends than play board games with matt at a brewery
Bergs: He must really despise him
Matt: Definitely have to remember this phrase
Matt: You're next on my list
Nick: No I just meant they are jam packed  , and that's the next free one
Nick: Between friends/family visitors,  work travel, and work deadlines. This month is going to kill me
Bergs: I'm booked until 2028
Nick: Bergs may get arrested in China over his tattoos
Nick: Stay safe <@549395004569812994> !

TJ Tank: Whoooooa
sarahsalley951: <@392005946651443201> Logan is wearing a friend's shoes today (that are 11  sizes too  big) to Surprise his friends today. To jazz up the last day of school. He's a shoe head

acowinthecrowd: the carrier is just the best thing to have
acowinthecrowd: i remember our kids would just go everywhere around the house in em
acowinthecrowd: and they're so much quicker than a stroller
acowinthecrowd: like for the store
acowinthecrowd: or for going anywhere, you can even keep wearing it (sans baby) while driving and it's just ready to plop em in when you get there
Bergs: Cal built no help
Bergs: The directions  in digital do rock

#politics-but-only-the-good-stuff:
Bergs: https://x.com/spencerhakimian/status/1923538441276461069?s=46
Bergs: Hahaha
Andy: Your life your choice dear bergs, but speaking from sole experience I feel a lot better when im not getting a hit of politics right as I wake up (or go to sleep)
Bergs: Would it make you feel better if I told you after checking twitter as I brew coffee I read an actual, real book ?
Andy: It wouldn't
Andy: It's not a criticism, just passing on something I've found beneficial recently
Bergs: Does reading about politics online give you anxiety?
Andy: Not directly
Andy: But evidence suggests that indirectly it does
Bergs: I used to have a rule that i didn’t check my phone after 9pm
Bergs: That was a good rule
Matt: I think it definitely jolts you into the media world instead of just existing in your own world with your kids or whoever
Matt: It's like "oh right everything's fucked out there, for many other people"
Bergs: The Jon line of defense here would be “our parents have been watching the morning news for 50 years”.
Andy: Ah yes, those famed rationalists, the boomers
Bergs: “In the 1800s, people would just go to the bulletin board to read about all the awful shit in their community”
Bergs: Haha not saying I agree, but these are often arguments presented around these parts
Bergs: I think looking at this stuff particularly the short form shit you find on twitter and other social media , is not good for you.
Matt: Boomers waking up to morning news is equally as bad
Matt: I can't stand it
Matt: It's like
Matt: You have a nice quiet house here
Matt: Everything is wonderful
Matt: Why are you poisoning it
Matt: (this is me yelling at someone watching the news on a quiet morning)
Matt: That would take some effort haha
Bergs: Just like the claim pop culture isn’t in a place of stagnation due to all the creativity overflowing into tik tok, i guess my claim is that we have been doom scrolling for all of human history !
Bergs: Someone getting woken up from a deep sleep by the town crier/herald in medieval England !
Andy: Bad take
Bergs: My specialty
Bergs: I actually don't believe that and aligned am with you Andy.  This is just what I hear from the "life is a flat circle crowd" aka you can't make value judgements on anything because every generation goes through this dissonance
Andy: Name em
Andy: Tag em
Andy: EXPOSE EM
Bergs: Haha you know, we know, they know
Bergs: What do you do first thing in the morning <@297550265299763212> , give me a good routine
Andy: Doom scroll, then 6 hours pass before you wake up and I forget about it
Bergs: This is totally off topic but what would you say your biggest interest is - and second question is how do you consume news on that topic
Andy: This question has stressed me out
Andy: I honestly don't know what my interests are - I like games, movies, music & sport but really it's just consuming media right?
Andy: Is my cat an interest?
Andy: Can my wife be an interest?
Bergs: Yes!  Do you check a cat sub reddit haha
Bergs: Or I guess for sports let's say
Bergs: Footy
Bergs: Do you read or listen to podcasts on it
Bergs: Or just watch
Andy: Ok, football we have -

A (theoretical) football forum, but with specific team threads, so I'll look in the Liverpool thread, or other teams thread if I'm bored

R/soccer (but not r/LiverpoolFC as its full of the international fans cosplaying as diehards)

Podcasts - up to 3 options, you could feasibly do more. However, I specifically avoid 'punditry' around it (also a reddit issue, too much yapping)

The Guardian app ofc

Very occasionally after a major result I may see a YouTube analysis video
Bergs: Ok there you go !  Sounds like a fertile garden
Bergs: https://x.com/yashar/status/1924519962397360221?s=46
Bergs: Unreal
Matt: Uhh
Matt: The person shot BY police
Matt: And what happened to the people who attacked that other police officer, who died the following day?
Matt: I believe they were pardoned
Matt: Was it a Trump-appointed judge?

#food:
Andy: Sincere congrats on having a meal with unprocessed vegetables in it
sarahsalley951: I like having things like this for emergencies. The problem is that it takes two to three to feed us which can be painful, but still worth it to have
Bergs: Man
Bergs: Great use of air fryer - salsa !
acowinthecrowd: ……. wut
Bergs: Yeah dude, just halve some tomatoes , jalapeños , onion , garlic, spray with some cooking spray and blast it in the air fryer
Bergs: Peel skin off , blend with some lime juice, cilantro, and salt pepper
Bergs: Boom
acowinthecrowd: You’re putting liquid into your air fryer?
Bergs: What do you mean
Bergs: The tomatoes Def give off liquid
Nick: This is the prep work
Bergs: What is salsa if not prep work
Nick: I was telling <@163849350827606016>
Bergs: He's moving a bit slow today, go easy on him
acowinthecrowd: I don’t wanna be gaslit anymore but I don’t cook salsa in an air fryer.
Bergs: You should try it
Bergs: https://youtube.com/shorts/NVPHyDKByYs?si=PIExaMIDE2Pd-Vvz
Nick: Wasn't gaslighting, was helping.  Charring/roasting releases alot of flavor
acowinthecrowd: Mambo italiano
acowinthecrowd: <@178958369955119104> Logan got some peach rings the other day
acowinthecrowd: And man….
acowinthecrowd: You’re spot on
acowinthecrowd: So friggin good
Big Jon: I knew Logan had a good head on his shoulders
Bergs: Didn't we have an argument about these?  Jon calls them like "gas station gummies" or something weird
acowinthecrowd: I sure hope so cause that is weird af
Bergs: Omg matt and whit
acowinthecrowd: Hahhahaha
acowinthecrowd: Classic those guys
croasus: https://tenor.com/view/nodding-dan-levy-david-david-rose-schitts-creek-gif-20255697
Matt: Good times
Bergs: I love how Matt in the early minutes of me making fun of him tried to reverse dunk on me when he got some fake confidence cause Whit also didn't know 😂
croasus: I feel like this is also a slam on me 😂
Bergs: Haha you are collateral damage for sure
Matt: Was just saving you time
acowinthecrowd: I like seeing how much use you get out of your creuset
Bergs: A good dutch oven (regardless of brand) is just so useful!
acowinthecrowd: That’s what they say

#work-stuff:
Andy: We're adding a 50 Euro surcharge for any shippers not using our inland haulage in Belgium
Andy: I'm already looking forward to the investigation of why our customer satisfaction score has tanked
Nick: Almost like how our single carrier booking agent fee, we charge customers $50 to have us book on their behalf with maersk
Bergs: No wonder you guys can’t hang onto any order management business
Nick: Gotta win it to hold on to it
Nick: And we cant even do that currently
Bergs: Haha
Nick: Currently my team was asked how are we driving the pipeline for new business , but also my rebuttal is were not sales nor do we have a budget to be meeting new customers 

We dont do any of the trade conventions , and were at the mercy of sales.  Sales doesnt want to sell a product where they only get a SIP when they sell 3 year contract and also a product that causes the most amount if heachaches and followup for them once live
Bergs: Our team that's the same as you guys has to maintain a pipeline of 50 customers at all time
Bergs: I find order management guys love to blame sales for everything so this all tracks
Nick: When sales brings us a customer to talk to sure, but its not our job to be on the streets finding the customer
Bergs: Yeah you are parasites
acowinthecrowd: You need to work on being a team player
Andy: Omg a sales guy blaming an ops guy!
Bergs: Nick isn't ops
Andy: Omg an ops guy blaming a sales guy!
Andy: This is groundbreaking
Bergs: He's wanna be sales
Bergs: That doesn't have to do anything hard
Bergs: That has to do with sales
Andy: ☝️
Bergs: We have these same leeches - they get on the phone and complain about sales not generating enough leads but are too lazy to even talk to the sales people haha
Bergs: They'll only talk to mgmt
acowinthecrowd: Middle managers, the true parasites
acowinthecrowd: I think all of you need to come together and realize your true enemy is finance.
acowinthecrowd: They set the impossible to sell rates and are stingy with the budgets
Andy: Amen!
Bergs: Hmmm
Bergs: Finance is not in charge of pricing
Bergs: BUT
Bergs: They are in charge of credit
Bergs: Which is true they are an enemy
Big Jon: Its the shareholders that are the true enemy
acowinthecrowd: Look at the big brain on Jon
Andy: Yknow who I hate? The CUSTOMER
acowinthecrowd: The American people are your problem, buying all this junk
Bergs: The true enemy is the enemy within
Matt: https://tenor.com/view/what-would-you-say-you-do-here-interview-office-space-gif-17713133
Nick: Is this scm shippers or ocean ?
Andy: Errrr, unclear to me
Andy: No way Nike pays it, so I'm not that arsed <:bergs:929073310019502141>

acowinthecrowd: BOOM
Bergs: Be honest
Bergs: How hungover were you yesterday
acowinthecrowd: shockingly less than expected, probably only like a 6
Bergs: Some beautiful children's books
Big Jon: <@487577343079088128> <@549395004569812994>  Sanderson, Brown, and Abercrombie did a joint Q&A is Salt Lake City yesterday! Man, I would have taken a day off work to do this is in ATL
Bergs: Wow!  Murderers row of nerds
Bergs: Who was reading Sanderson was that you Jon?
TJ Tank: Whaaaaaat
TJ Tank: Dude seriously
Big Jon: Yeah, and Tommy. Hated it
Bergs: Hahaha why??
Bergs: I didn't care for the one I tried, it was def entertaining and cool world building but felt like a marvel movie set in high fantasy
Big Jon: Terrible dialog, boring characters, it was like it was written by a nerd that had never spoken to a female before
Big Jon: Magic system was cool though
Big Jon: Mistborn
Bergs: I tried way of kings I think maybe 5 years ago haha

Matt: That's actually pretty sick
Matt: $30 to play without a real computer
Matt: I can't remember if that includes games or not
acowinthecrowd: it does not
Andy: Combines with gamepass though right?
Andy: (I'm googling Matt's question and got that answer)
acowinthecrowd: i would hope so
acowinthecrowd: but probably not all games
acowinthecrowd: cause it's not your machine to install on of course
acowinthecrowd: so it's limited to what they've got installed
acowinthecrowd: if i recall the list is quite extensive though
acowinthecrowd: but you might not be playing super meat boy on it
acowinthecrowd: or whatever the latest furry porn game that you're into is
Andy: It's still super meat boy
Andy: https://tenor.com/view/super-meat-boy-nugget-wave-bye-gif-25327180

Bergs: I need to cancel and do this

#musix:
Bergs: <@244563940242096138> need you
Bergs: Powered bookshelf speakers that can plug into a TV and also play Bluetooth music
Bergs: Under $200
Jeremy M: How do you want them to plug into the tv?
Bergs: Umm earc or hdmi?
Jeremy M: Hmm that might be hard I'll look around
Bergs: OK cool
Bergs: Any other ideas welcome
Jeremy M: Well optical is easy but you'll need a separate remote for volume
Jeremy M: https://a.co/d/cNHciYK these are pretty much the only E-arc pair of bookshelves I see recommended at this price point
Bergs: OK thanks dude any other ideas on a budget are welcome!
Bergs: Could be a different set up
Bergs: Trying to figure out something for the garage
Matt: Reggaeton club hits are so innocently sweet
Matt: It'll be the most bass heavy song, and when you check the translation it's always the way a 12 year old would profess their love for their crush
Nick: <@487577343079088128>
Bergs: AI?

#nonsense:
Matt: Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy, but here's my bumble profile and if you like it then maybe we can chat on there for a while and if that goes well, maybe you can get my number and ask me on a date and we could meet in perso- OH RIGHT
acowinthecrowd: and then they see you keep your phone on 11% at 9:13am
acowinthecrowd: flag redder than your battery bar
acowinthecrowd: i tried to match you but i'd have to download bumble and i dunno if that would go over well
Matt: There is a section for friends on there. But, it's so weird, swiping right on dudes hahaha
acowinthecrowd: maybe if had kept my goatee
sarahsalley951: I already got on it when I saw your facial hair pic
acowinthecrowd: i bet your phone exploded with all the swipe rights on you
sarahsalley951: Yeah but only because I put Luna as my pic
Matt: Every time I see signs like this I can't help but read them as "it's fine to park here if you pay $50"
acowinthecrowd: Haha I mean…… that IS what it’s saying right??
acowinthecrowd: It’s not illegal to park here it just costs 50 bucks
Matt: $50? Fine, no problem
Matt: I like the littering ones better. $1000 Fine Littering on Highway.

OH okay so if the value of my trash is 1000+ then it's okay?
Matt: I realize how stupid that interpretation is but it's HOW I READ IT

Nick: They still working on it ?
acowinthecrowd: Took em a little over an hour
acowinthecrowd: Definitely cleaner than when I came in, but, and it could be my expectations of a maintenance versus full detail, but I’m not fully impressed
acowinthecrowd: I know better than to expect like the upholstery shampooed
acowinthecrowd: But the windshield has smudges, for example
acowinthecrowd: All the windows really
sarahsalley951: Omg even Luna's window?😭
acowinthecrowd: even lunas window =\
sarahsalley951: I think they put smudges on it. It's so bad

#health:
Nick: 211!
Andy: Nice man, how are you doing it?
Nick: Just diet control really,  cook unity has been helpful with smaller portions and really trying to limit the snacking i do
Nick: Also at the gym, I stopped lifting so heavy and going more reps when I can
Nick: (Also been sick twice in the last month cause of Jordan at daycare bringing home germs. So be ready for that )
Andy: Nice
Andy: Nice
Andy: Nice
acowinthecrowd: Nice
acowinthecrowd: only eating cook unity, that must be like... what 700 cals/day?
Nick: No but it drastically reduces the meals at dinner, lunch i typically make a sandwich.. breakfast is hit and miss. Eggs and toast or nothing
