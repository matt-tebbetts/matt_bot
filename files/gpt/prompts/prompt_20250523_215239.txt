========================================

[user]:
summarize the recent drama Keep it to 2-3 sentences, but mention specific topics, movies, games, or issues discussed. Do not just say 'users are discussing movies' or 'users are talking about games.' Instead, name the actual movies, games, or issues and describe the nature of the discussion (e.g., disagreement, praise, recommendations, troubleshooting, etc.). Summarize it as if you're a 24/7 news reporter who needs to make fun and interesting headlines. Example of a bad summary: 'Users are discussing movies and games.'
Example of a good summary: 'In #things-we-watch, Matt and Sarah debated whether Dune was overrated, with Matt praising the visuals and Sarah saying it was too slow. In #crossword-corner, users shared Octordle scores and debugged the /gpt command, with acowinthecrowd expressing frustration about privacy and Matt reassuring them about data deletion.'
