[crossword-corner] Matt_Bot: **Matt:** why doesn't Brice see the new /gpt slash command on discord even though it works and I see it right now and am using it

**ChatGPT:** Based on the provided message snippet, it seems like Brice might not see the new /gpt slash command on Discord. However, since you can see and use the command, it indicates that the command is available and working as intended. 

There could be a few reasons why Brice doesn't see the new /gpt slash command:
1. **Permissions**: Brice might not have the necessary permissions to view or use the slash command. Make sure Brice has the appropriate roles or permissions to access new commands.
   
2. **Client or App Issues**: Sometimes, Discord clients or apps might not show updates immediately. Brice can try refreshing the Discord app or logging out and back in to see if the new command appears.
   
3. **Server-Specific Command**: The /gpt slash command might be specific to a certain server or channel. Ensure that Brice is in the correct server or channel where the command is available.

Encourage Brice to check these points to troubleshoot why they might not be seeing the new /gpt slash command on Discord.
